Notebooks on Kaggle (not available yet)

*"In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system".*

**Dataset:**  
personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.

**Steps to submit:**
- exploration analysis along with data preparation;
- model comparison with LazyPredict;
- final model training and submit prepare.

**Result:**  
**130**th place out of about 2.5K participants in the "Spaceship Titanic" machine learning competition.

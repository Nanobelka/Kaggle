**Initiator:** [IceCube neutrino observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/).

**Input data:**
- pulses recorded by photomultipliers (sensors);
- events in which impulses are grouped;
- data about the physical coordinates of the sensors.

**Purpose**:
- understand the physical process;
- understand the essence of the input data and their correspondence to the physical process;
- identify as more different areas for analysis as possible, then to choose the most useful ones;
- make an assumption about the principle of model creating for trajectory determination.

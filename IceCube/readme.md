# [Exploratory data analysis for the IceCube project](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nanobelka/Kaggle/blob/main/IceCube/IceCube_1_EDA.ipynb)
## Determine neutrino trajectories based on data provided by the IceCube neutrino observatory.

[Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icecube-neutrinos-in-deep-ice/)

**initiator:** [IceCube neutrino observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/).

**Input data:**

- pulses recorded by photomultipliers (sensors);
- events in which impulses are grouped;
- data about the physical coordinates of the sensors.

**Project goal:** preliminary data analysis.

**Project objectives:**

- understand the principles and details of the formation of input data (the input description is practically absent);
- identification of possible directions for in-depth analysis (full elaboration is not necessary, the main thing is to fix the idea for further study).
